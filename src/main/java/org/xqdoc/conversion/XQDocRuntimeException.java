/**
 * The base xqDoc runtime exception that will be used when processing a xqDoc
 * Comment block. By using a runtime exception, this enabled easier integration
 * with antlr and did not require the pollution of signatures with a 'throw'
 * clause just because of xqDoc comment processing problems. This is really
 * meant to be a short-term solution since the longer term plan is to move the
 * xqDoc Comment block processing into the antlr grammar and eliminating the
 * need for the XQDocComment class and this runtime exception.
